The files in this directory (chan395/pdfs) contain velocity and
pressure probability density functions extracted from direct numerical
simulations of fully developed plane turbulent channel flow at
Re_tau=395. The simulations are reported in "DNS of Turbulent Channel
Flow up to Re_tau=590," by R. D. Moser, J. Kim & N. N. Mansour, 1999
(Phys. Fluids, vol 11, pg 943-945).

This directory contains a set of files named chan395.pdf.<number>,
where the number indicates the y-location of the pdf (in + units
rounded to the nearest integer).

Please report any problems with the data to R. D. Moser
r-moser@uiuc.edu.
